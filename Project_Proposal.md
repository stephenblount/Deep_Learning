## Drowsiness Detection

One of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents is falling asleep at the wheel. The purpose of the project is to build a computer vision model to detect when a driver is drowsy. A convolution neural network will be the backbone of the classification process to determine whether a person's eyes are open or closed.  The MRL dataset will be used for the image classification proportion, with a binary flag for eyes that are opened or closed. The MRL eye dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains 84,898 images of eyes with varying properties: gender, glasses, eye state, reflections, lighting conditions, and type of sensor. All of the images are in infrared to allow for capturing drowsiness at night. Once a competent neural network is trained, OpenCV will be used with the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces and eyes. The goal will be to interface this with a webcam to determine if a person is drowsy based on the duration their eyes are closed for.
